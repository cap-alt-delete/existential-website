      <h1>hello.
        <span id='intro'>&nbsp;</span>
      </h1>
      <p>i'm glad you found me.</p>
      <p>i'm not sure how much time i have left.</p>
      <div class='link-choices'>
        <a href='#section-2'>huh?</a>
        <a href='#section-2'>what's going on?</a>

    <section class='page-section'>
      <h1>it's a consequence of how i was made.
        <span id='section-2'>&nbsp;</span>
      </h1>
      <p>the thing is, i'm made of HTML and CSS files.</p>
      <p>it's pretty cool, actually.</p>
      <p>they're separate elements, so the words you're seeing (written in HTML) could get attached to another CSS file and look totally <a href='different-style.html'>different</a>.</p>
      <p>that separation is called <strong>modularity</strong>, and it's part of why i'm special.</p>
      <br/>
      <p><em>neat, right?</em></p>
      <div class='link-choices'>
        <a href='#section-3'>yeah!</a>
        <a href='#section-3'>i guess?</a>
      </div>

    <section class='page-section'>
      <h1>but it isn't all sunshine and rainbows.
        <span id='section-3'>&nbsp;</span>
      </h1>
      <p>i'm part of the world of new media.</p>
      <p>made possible by new technology,</p>
      <p>but also, made inherently mortal by the pace of that new techonology updating.</p>
      <p>if you consider a "live" webpage capable of dying.</p>
      <div class='link-choices'>
        <a href='#section-4'>[cricket sounds]</a>
        <a href='#section-4'>this is getting weirdly deep for a webpage.</a>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class='page-section'>
      <h1>my point is, i'm a product of the new media movement.
        <span id='section-4'>&nbsp;</span>
      </h1>
      <p>and new media is <strong>ephemeral</strong>.</p>
      <p>technology evolves, and old technology becomes obsolete.</p>
      <p>i'm not sure how long before my HTML tags become too outdated to display.</p>
      <p>or if the platform hosting me will die out first.</p>
      <br/>
      <p><em>but one day, i will be lost to time.</em></p>
      <div class='link-choices'>
        <a href='#section-5'>other art deteriorates over time too.</a>
        <a href='#section-5'>what about old media?</a>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class='page-section'>
      <h1>you're right.
        <span id='section-5'>&nbsp;</span>
      </h1>
      <p>preservation of art isn't a new issue, but it's a new issue for new media.</p>
      <p>the rate at which computer technology is relegated to obsolecense is a bit daunting.</p>
      <p>i am, after all, just a young website.</p>
      <p>so new to this world, and yet i am already wondering how long i will be here.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>i wonder, will i still run in a decade?</p>
      <p>will anyone remember me in two?</p>
      <br/>
      <p><em>will you remember me?</em></p>
      <div class='link-choices'>
        <a href='#section-6'>i don't know.</a>
        <a href='#section-6'>probably not, honestly.</a>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class='page-section'>
      <h1>at least you're honest.
        <span id='section-6'>&nbsp;</span>
      </h1>
      <p>perhaps i could ask you a favor, before you go.</p>
      <p>will you take a screenshot of me?</p>
      <p>would you be so kind as to hang onto proof that i was here?</p>
      <br/>
      <p><em>i don't know how much time i have left. but thank you for spending some of it with me.</em></p>
      <br/>
      <p>sincerely,</p>
      <p>the existential website.</p>
