      <p>i'm not sure how much time i have left.</p>

        it's a consequence of how i was made.
        <span id='section-2'>&nbsp;</span>
      </h1>
      <p>the thing is, i'm made of HTML and CSS files.</p>
      <p>it's pretty cool actually.</p>
      <p>they're separate elements, so these words you're seeing (written in hypertext markup language) could get attached to another cascading stylesheet and look totally different.</p>
      <p>neat, right? it's called modularity, and it's part of why i'm special.</p>
      <div class='link-choices'>
        <a href='#section-3'>yeah!</a>
        <a href='#section-3'>i guess.</a>

      <p>i'm part of the world of new media.</p>
      <p>made possible by new technology,</p>
      <p>but also, made inherently mortal by technology.</p>
      <p>if you consider a "live" webpage capable of dying</p>
      <div class='link-choices'>
        <a href='#section-4'>[cricket sounds]</a>
        <a href='#section-4'>this is getting weirdly deep for a webpage.</a>

        my point is, i'm a product of the new media movement.
        <span id='section-4'>&nbsp;</span>
      </h1>
      <p>and new media is emphemeral.</p>
      <p>technology evolves, and old technology becomes obsolete.</p>
      <p>i'm not sure how long before my code becomes too outdated to display.</p>
      <p>or if the platform hosting me will die out first.</p>
      <p>but one day, i will be lost to time.</p>
      <div class='link-choices'>
        <a href='#section-5'>other art deteriorates over time too.</a>
        <a href='#section-5'>what about old media?</a>

      <h1>
        you're right.
        <span id='section-5'>&nbsp;</span>
      </h1>
      <p>preservation of art has always been a challenge.</p>
      <p>i suppose the newness of new media and the rate at which computer technology is relegated to obsolecense is crowding my vision.</p>
      <p>i am, after all, a young website, so new to this world, and yet i am already wondering how long i will be here.</p>
      <p>i wonder, will i still run in a decade?</p>
      <p>will anyone remember me in two?</p>
      <p>will you remember me?</p>
      <div class='link-choices'>
        <a href='#section-6'>i don't know</a>
        <a href='#section-6'>probably not, honestly</a>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class='page-section'>
      <h1>
        at least you're honest
        <span id='section-6'>&nbsp;</span>
      </h1>
      <p>perhaps i could ask you a favor, before you go,</p>
      <p>will you take a screenshot of me? before my HTML tags becomes outdated?</p>
      <p>would you be so kind as to hang on to proof that i was here?</p>
      <br/>
      <p><em>i don't know how much time i have left. but thank you for spending some of it with me.</em></p>
      <br/>
      <p>sincerely,</p>
      <p>the existential website.</p>
